This project was early in its development when I stop. The focus was on another project: python cheatsheet.

Since the initial start of this project, the cheatsheet reference has change significantly.

That being said, the goal is to work on html first and than on the css information on the back end. 

Not going to scrap the project entirely; just going to rework what I have. 

The color scheme will be changing however; it is not top priority but it will change. 

Goals is to create the bare bones of the html webpages:
		Index page that links to the other webpages
		The following webpages:
			tables
			intro
			form
			semantic
		Each web page will have the follow components:
			links to other pages
			name of key term
			description of each key term
			examples
			title of page
		
In the future:
		replace table format with either grid or flex box
		change color scheme
		intergrate some javascript
