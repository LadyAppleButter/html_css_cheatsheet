Time: 6:41pm

This project was early in its development when I stop. The focus was on another project: python cheatsheet.

Since the initial start of this project, the cheatsheet reference has change significantly.

That being said, the goal is to work on html first and than on the css information on the back end. 

Not going to scrap the project entirely; just going to rework what I have. 

The color scheme will be changing however; it is not top priority but it will change. 

Goals is to create the bare bones of the html webpages:
		Index page that links to the other webpages
		The following webpages:
			tables
			intro
			form
			semantic
		Each web page will have the follow components:
			links to other pages
			name of key term
			description of each key term
			examples
			title of page
		
In the future:
		replace table format with either grid or flex box
		change color scheme
		intergrate some javascript

Today's agenda:
		Rework index to be the main html page
		Link the current pages together
		Rename the pages to more suitable titles
		create a page for:
			semantic
			table
			intro

To-Done:
		Removed all the previous content from index
		Renamed the h1 of index to Main
		Created 3 new html files:
			semantic
			table
			intro 
		Created new folder called misc
		Moved position file to misc folder
		Connected the necessary files together with links
		

Next Time: 
		update form file

Thoughts:
		There is no rhyme or reason for the order of information on the codecademy website. The order listed above is how it is ordered on their webpage. After everything log in, a method of order for this webpage needs to be determine. Also, not all their entries have examples attached to them. 
		
For Next Time:
		Tackle 4 topics:
			Submitting a Form
			Required Attribute
			max Attribute
			maxlength Attribute
					
				
Notes: 
		Whenever we tackle the style sheet, some the rows and subrows will need to be renamed.
		
Plan for form.html:
		Work on 4 topics
		Work on the last 4 topics
		Tweek existing information
		Rearrange rows
		Finale clean up
