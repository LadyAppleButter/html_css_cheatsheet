Date: Wednesday 21 September 22 
Time: 6:41pm

This project was early in its development when I stop. The focus was on another project: python cheatsheet.

Since the initial start of this project, the cheatsheet reference has change significantly.

That being said, the goal is to work on html first and than on the css information on the back end. 

Not going to scrap the project entirely; just going to rework what I have. 

The color scheme will be changing however; it is not top priority but it will change. 

Goals is to create the bare bones of the html webpages:
		Index page that links to the other webpages
		The following webpages:
			tables
			intro
			form
			semantic
		Each web page will have the follow components:
			links to other pages
			name of key term
			description of each key term
			examples
			title of page
		
In the future:
		replace table format with either grid or flex box
		change color scheme
		intergrate some javascript

Today's agenda:
		Rework index to be the main html page
		Link the current pages together
		Rename the pages to more suitable titles
		create a page for:
			semantic
			table
			intro

To-Done:
		Removed all the previous content from index
		Renamed the h1 of index to Main
		Created 3 new html files:
			semantic
			table
			intro 
		Created new folder called misc
		Moved position file to misc folder
		Connected the necessary files together with links
		

Next Time: 
		update form file

Thoughts:
		There is no rhyme or reason for the order of information on the codecademy website. The order listed above is how it is ordered on their webpage. After everything log in, a method of order for this webpage needs to be determine. Also, not all their entries have examples attached to them. 
		
For Next Time:
		Tackle 4 topics:
			Submitting a Form
			Required Attribute
			max Attribute
			maxlength Attribute
					
				
Notes: 
		Whenever we tackle the style sheet, some the rows and subrows will need to be renamed.
		
Plan for form.html:
		Work on 4 topics
		Work on the last 4 topics
		Tweek existing information
		Rearrange rows
		Finale clean up

Objective: transition from basic html and css to more advance css.

Today Agenda: Break the page into sections

Task to Complete:
Define sections
Create a copy of the html file
Create a copy of the css file
Create two blocks of text

Task Completed:
Define sections
	title
	headings
	defintion
	body
	target
Create copies
	realize the links on the page were in connecting to the original file; created a folder to hold the new html and css files

Note: when creating a flexbox, it is important to define what that flexbox is. Originally was using multiple selectors to define a flexbox. Apparently, that is a big no no. The assumption is that multiple selectors implies multiple area of coverage; to initiate a flexbox the area needs to specific, at least that our interruptation. 

For Next Time:
Create two blocks of text

		
Date: Thursday 13 July 2023
Time: 4:40pm

Note: to open an html file type use start "file.html"

Today's Agenda: 
Create child container(2) within in a flexbox

Tasks:
Within the .definition container, two child elements will be created
	1) for now, it is just be the word and definition 
	2) information will be pulled from form.html

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp

To-Done:
Added terms and phrases to webpage to guage how they move when changing the css file
Added height and margins to the .definition container
Incapsulate the terms and phrases into their own boxes
Found an article on creating hover drop down list

Note:
Just like it was important to define the container; it was also important to define the content.
Found out adding css to the container did very little to the content. 
The content needs to be access on a seperate line of code for there to be any affects.
.flexbox > div for example

For Next Time: 
We will impliment the hover drop down menu
Possibley look up an example on youtube or tiktok
