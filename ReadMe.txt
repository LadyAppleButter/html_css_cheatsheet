>> use start "file.html" to open an html file in a web browser

///2024///


2024 October 12 Saturday

We noticed a folder named misc and it contained a file named postion.html.
Do not know why it is seperate from the rest of the files.
It has comments dated back to 2020.
Fixed the pathing to the css page

UPDATE
	form_adv
		> added cotent to the rest of the table
		> added commented out headings to easily id items on the table
		> added a template for future web pages

NEXT TIME
> formatting the table
	> middle column: either change the text wrap or the size of the column
	> padding in between the rows

FUTURE TASKS
> formate links 
> decide on keeping 'form element'
> formate h1
> remove unnecessary code
> rewrite definitions and examples 
> decide on themes and fonts
> add a 'back to top' Button
> add the rest of the web pages
> connect pages 

2024 October 10 Thursday

It has been awhile. Working on another project and wanted to update ( and maybe continue) this project.

UPDATE

FORM
	> Had to comment some items; 
		> 'key term and phrases'; does not feel necessary but don't want to delete it youtube
		> 'input'; cannot find where we got that info. does not appear to be on the previous form page
	> Renamed a class to remove redunacey
		> 'definition' to 'info-table'
	> Added definitions and examples to 'input' and 'datalist' 
	> Added divs and classes to the remaining info-table

STYLES
	> commented out old style for the body 
	> note: found out the display we were trying to use was not working because we was using to the wrond selector type ('.body instead of body')
	> seperated css into sections
	> added class selector (info-table) and set display to grid
		> set grid to display 3 columns with some margins and gutter for readablity

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> November >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

____________________ DATE: Friday 17 November 23 ____________________

The object of today is to update the look and flow of the read me page.		


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> July >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

____________________Date: Thursday 13 July 2023 ____________________
TIME: 4:40pm

NOTES: to open an html file type use start "file.html"

AGENDA: 
Create child container(2) within in a flexbox

TASKS:
Within the .definition container, two child elements will be created
	1) for now, it is just be the word and definition 
	2) information will be pulled from form.html

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp

TO-DONE:
Added terms and phrases to webpage to guage how they move when changing the css file
Added height and margins to the .definition container
Incapsulate the terms and phrases into their own boxes
Found an article on creating hover drop down list

NOTES:
Just like it was important to define the container; it was also important to define the content.
Found out adding css to the container did very little to the content. 
The content needs to be access on a seperate line of code for there to be any affects.
.flexbox > div for example

NEXT TIME: 
We will impliment the hover drop down menu
Possibley look up an example on youtube or tiktok

OBEJECTIVE: transition from basic html and css to more advance css.

AGENDA: Break the page into sections

Task to Complete:
Define sections
Create a copy of the html file
Create a copy of the css file
Create two blocks of text

Task Completed:
Define sections
	title
	headings
	defintion
	body
	target
Create copies
	realize the links on the page were in connecting to the original file; created a folder to hold the new html and css files

NOTES:
 when creating a flexbox, it is important to define what that flexbox is. Originally was using multiple selectors to define a flexbox. Apparently, that is a big no no. The assumption is that multiple selectors implies multiple area of coverage; to initiate a flexbox the area needs to specific, at least that our interruptation. 

FOR NEXT TIME:
Create two blocks of text

THOUGHTS:
		There is no rhyme or reason for the order of information on the codecademy website. The order listed above is how it is ordered on their webpage. After everything log in, a method of order for this webpage needs to be determine. Also, not all their entries have examples attached to them.
